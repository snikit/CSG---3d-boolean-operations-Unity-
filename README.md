CSG - 3d boolean operations (Unity)


3d Boolean Operations(CSG) on Meshes in the editor or via script at runtime.
Specially helpful in punching windows or holes during level design or in game.

...................................

Constructive solid geometry allows a modeler to create a complex surface or object by using Boolean operators to combine simpler objects, generating visually complex objects by combining a few primitive ones.
These operations are :
1.Subtraction
2.Union
3.Intersection

Please Note: This version of CSG works with Unity versions 2019.4 or higher.



Features:
*Choose between three Boolean operations
* Example script and scenes attached
* Custom material can be provided for the new geometry involved in operation.
* Allows you to create instant prefab.
* Helps in quick level designs for example designing windows , holes etc.
* All the transforms and coordinates of original meshes are preserved.
