3d Boolean Operations(CSG) on Meshes in the editor or via script at runtime.
Specially helpful in punching windows or holes during level design or in game.

...................................

Constructive solid geometry allows a modeler to create a complex surface or object by using Boolean operators to combine simpler objects, generating visually complex objects by combining a few primitive ones.
These operations are :
1.Subtraction
2.Union
3.Intersection

Please Note: This version of CSG works with Unity versions 2019.4 or higher.



Features:
*Choose between three Boolean operations
* Example script and scenes attached
* Custom material can be provided for the new geometry involved in operation.
* Allows you to create instant prefab.
* Helps in quick level designs for example designing windows , holes etc.
* All the transforms and coordinates of original meshes are preserved.
